# :wave: ABOUT
The Portfolio is a single page application providing a user friendly accessibility to my resume broken down into an introduction, project list, skill list and a chance to download the soft copy of the resume. The website is entirely front-end built using React JS, HTML and CSS.
You can view the deployed application below

# :question: HOW TO USE
The user's landing page is the 'About Me' section with accessibility to navigation links that direct them to specific sections in the Portfolio Website. There's multiple opporunities provided to download a soft copy of the reume and/or visit my social media accounts to see the sited projects in further detail. 

# :computer: BEHIND THE SCENES

- JavaScript

- Node.Js
- Material Icons

# :pencil2: THE PLANNING
The idea behind this project was to provide a user-friendly breakdown of the resume/CV where the user can access different sections of the resume depending on their point of focus and have direct navigation links to each project.

I used Figma to create a simple conceptual design of the website to see the breakdown of the single-page. Each section was detailed differently to reflect how I wanted each of the resume sections to be presented to the user. This also helped me find out what features I needed.

# :bulb: FEATURES TO BE ADDED IN
- With additional time, I would like to work out how to require/import a PDF into the download links using React JS to allow the user to download a PDF version of the resume rather than an image copy.
- I would also like to further advance the CSS to make the whole webpage responsive to different media sizes.
